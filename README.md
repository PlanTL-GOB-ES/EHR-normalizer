#  Electronic Health Record (EHR) normalizer     

### Introduction
------------

This software converts PDF files into HTML, TXT or XML. First, it uses PDFMiner 
to process PDF files and to convert them into HTML files, retaining the 
exact layout of the documents, and then it converts these HTML files into TXT or 
XML. 

Additionally, the script can detect headers from ERRs and restore those lines 
that have been truncated by a previous PDF conversion.
 

### Prerequisites
-------------

This software requires to have PDFMiner installed on your system (included in 
the resources folder).
PDFMiner is distributed under its own license (see the LICENSE file).


### Directory structure
-------------------

<pre>
data/
This folder contains relevant information for the conversion process:
<pre>
  headers.txt
  This file contains a list of allowed headers for your EHRs. The 
  normalizer tries to match detected header candidates to this list.
	
  subheaders.txt
  This file contains a list of allowed subheaders for your EHRs. The  
  normalizer tries to match detected header candidates to this list. 
  This functionality is not implemented yet.
	
  patterns-to-remove.txt
  This file contains a list of RegEx patterns that you want to remove from 
  for your EHRs (e.g. privacy notes).
</pre>

your PDF files inside a "PDF" folder. Your "PDF" folder can contain other
