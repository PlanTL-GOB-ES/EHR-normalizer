# EHR-normalizer: Electronic Health Record (EHR) normalizer     


##  Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1492657


## Introduction
------------

This software converts PDF files into HTML, TXT or XML files. First, it uses PDFMiner 
to process PDF files and to convert them into HTML files, retaining the 
exact layout of the documents, and then it converts these HTML files into TXT or 
XML files. 

Additionally, the script can detect headers from EHRs and restore those lines 
that have been truncated by a previous PDF conversion process.

Language covered: Spanish and Catalan.


## Prerequisites
-------------

This software requires to have PDFMiner installed on your system. Note that PDFMiner 
is distributed under its own license.


## Directory structure
-------------------

<pre>
data/
This folder contains relevant information for the conversion process:

  - headers.txt. This file contains a list of allowed headers for your EHRs. The 
  normalizer tries to match detected header candidates to this list.
	
  - subheaders.txt. This file contains a list of allowed subheaders for your EHRs.
  The normalizer tries to match detected header candidates to this list. This 
  functionality is not implemented yet.

  - patterns-to-remove.txt. This file contains a list of RegEx patterns that you 
  want to remove from for your EHRs (e.g. privacy notes).

documents/
Default root folder of source PDF files. It is mandatory to place all your PDF
files inside a "PDF" folder. Your "PDF" folder can contain other sub-directories. 
You can also use your our root folder using command-line arguments.

resources/
This folder contains PDFMiner, which must be installed in your system. If 
you want to use another software to convert from PDF to HTML or TXT, you must 
change the script pdf-to-html.pl to call the software you want to use.

scripts/
This folder contains the scripts needed to perform partial convertions. These
scripts can also be used individually.
